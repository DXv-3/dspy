# MCP Continual Policy Router

This module adds routing and contract enforcement for MCP responses. It includes:

- Request classification for selecting a contract.
- JSON Schema validation for enforcing structured output.
- A FastAPI server with `route_and_respond` and `respond_go_mode` endpoints.

See `EVIDENCE_PACK.md` for the evidence appendix that maps claims to implementation levers.
